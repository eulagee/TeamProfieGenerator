# TeamProfieGenerator.
 This project was taking node, and creating an HTML to generate a team profile. Three team members Manager, Engineer, and Intern would all need to generate. I made my code as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as possible, meaning this code could easily be manipulated to add additional team members. The code also needed to pass through testing for a file of employees, manager, engineer, and intern.


# Testing & Running the Application (video)

Testing was run using npm run test In order to ensure, all aspects of the application were working properly, I would continuously check each step of the way to make sure no error appeared, and many sure did. I simply entered node index.js , then followed the prompts of questions within the terminal to make sure, each one showed within the Html, and showed up well.
